# Wi-Fi Radar System with Object Detection and Web Interface (Using ESP32)

![Contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg)

ðŸ“Œ This repository contains the implementation of a **Wi-Fi Radar System** that uses an **ultrasonic sensor** to detect objects and transmits the distance data to a **web server** using **ESP32**. The detected objects are also displayed on a **graphical interface**, with real-time updates on their positions and distances.

## ðŸ“Œ About  

This project is designed to detect objects using an ultrasonic sensor, and the distances to these objects are sent to a web server. Simultaneously, the data is displayed on a graphical interface for real-time monitoring. The ultrasonic sensor is mounted on a **180-degree** servo motor for wider coverage. The entire system is controlled using an **Arduino Mega 2560** and an **ESP32** module for Wi-Fi connectivity.

## ðŸ§° Components Used  

-   **Arduino Mega 2560**: The main microcontroller that controls the ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and communication with the ESP32.
-   **ESP32**: Wi-Fi module used to transmit distance data from the Arduino to the web server.
-   **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures the distance from the sensor to an object.
-   **180Â° Servo Motor**: Rotates the ultrasonic sensor to scan a larger area.
-   **Graphical Interface** (PC or Device): Displays real-time data and object positions

## ðŸš€ Running Instructions

-   Upload the Code to Arduino Mega: First, upload the radar.ino code to the **Arduino Mega 2560** using the Arduino IDE. This code controls the ultrasonic sensor and the 180Â° servo motor, allowing the radar system to detect objects.
-   Run the Graphical Interface: After uploading the code to the Arduino, run the graphical interface on your PC or device. The interface will display real-time updates of the objects detected by the ultrasonic sensor, showing their positions and distances.
-   Start the ESP32 Code: **Without stopping the running system**, open and upload the ESP32 code to the ESP32 module. This will enable the Wi-Fi communication between the Arduino and the web server. Once the ESP32 code starts running, the distance data from the sensor will be transmitted to the web server.
-   Access the Web Server: Open your web browser and navigate to the web server's address to view the real-time distance data coming from the radar system. The server will display the distances of objects detected by the ultrasonic sensor in real-time, as they are updated from the ESP32.
